/**
 * Voice-activity detection and segment capture.
 *
 * This is the piece that makes the assistant reliable, and it exists because
 * the browser's SpeechRecognition does not. That API dies silently under
 * always-on use — Chrome throttles it, it stops firing events, and nothing you
 * can catch tells you it has gone deaf. Detecting that a human is speaking is
 * not a language problem, though; it is an energy problem, and energy on the
 * microphone signal is something we can measure ourselves, every frame, with no
 * black box that can quietly stop answering.
 *
 * So: a running-mean noise floor, a threshold above it, and a hysteresis gate.
 * When the signal crosses the threshold a fresh recorder starts; when it falls
 * quiet for long enough the recorder stops and hands back one self-contained
 * audio blob for the bridge to transcribe. The detection is instant and local
 * — that is what makes barge-in feel natural — and the words come back a moment
 * later from a real transcriber that cannot silently fail the way the browser
 * one did.
 *
 * Hearing himself is the one hard part. The microphone picks up JARVIS's own
 * voice through the speakers, and raw energy cannot tell that from the user.
 * Two things handle it: getUserMedia is asked for echo cancellation, which
 * removes most of the playback, and while he is speaking the trigger threshold
 * is raised so the residue that leaks through does not cross it. A text check
 * after transcription is the final backstop, in voice.ts.
